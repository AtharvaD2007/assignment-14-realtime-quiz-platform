## ▶️ Run Locally

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Open:

```text
http://localhost:5001
```

Host:

```text
http://localhost:5001/host.html
```

Player:

```text
http://localhost:5001/player.html
```

## 🔢 Scoring

Correct answers receive:

```text
Base score = 500
Maximum speed bonus = 500
```

Therefore:

- Instant correct answer = 1000 points
- Correct answer at 15 seconds = 500 points
- Wrong answer = 0 points

Formula:

```text
timeRemaining = max(0, 15000 - timeTakenMs)
speedBonus = round((timeRemaining / 15000) * 500)
score = 500 + speedBonus
```

The server calculates the actual answer time using its own clock. The client-provided `timeTakenMs` is not trusted for scoring.

## 🌐 Render Deployment

Create a Web Service on Render.

Build Command:

```bash
npm install
```

Start Command:

```bash
npm start
```

Environment variable:

```text
CORS_ORIGIN=*
```

Do not hard-code the Render port. The application automatically uses Render's `PORT` environment variable.

After deployment, the same Render URL serves:

```text
/
 /host.html
 /player.html
```

## 🔌 Socket Events

### Host

```text
quiz:create
quiz:start
```

### Player

```text
quiz:join
answer:submit
```

### Server broadcasts

```text
quiz:created
quiz:joined
lobby:update
quiz:started
question:start
answer:result
question:time_up
leaderboard:update
quiz:ended
quiz:error
```

## ⚠️ Important

Game state is stored in memory. Restarting the Node.js server removes all active quiz rooms.

For the assignment this is intentional and no database is required.
